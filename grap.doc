.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of Kernighan and Bentley's language for
typesetting graphs, as described in ``Grap-A Language for Typesetting
Graphs, Tutorial and User Manual,'' by Jon L. Bentley and Brian W.
Kernighan, revised May 1991, which is the primary source for
information on how to use
.Nm grap .
As of this writing, it is available electronically at 
.Li http://www.kohala.com/~rstevens/troff/cstr114.ps .
.Pp
This version is a black box implementation of 
.Nm grap ,
and some inconsistencies are to be expected.  The remainder of this
manual page will briefly outline the
.Nm
language as implemented here.
.Pp
.Nm
is a 
.Xr pic 1
pre-processor.  It takes commands embedded in a 
.Xr troff 1
source file which are surrounded by 
.Ic .G1
and
.Ic .G2
macros, and rewrites them into pic commands to display the graph.
Other lines are copied.  Output is always to the standard output,
which is usually reidrected.  Input is from the given
.Ar filename s,
which are read in the order given.  A 
.Ar filename 
of 
.Fl 
is the standard input.
If no 
.Ar filename s
are given, input is read from the standard input.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
is a 
.Xr pic 
preprocessor, and gnu 
.Xr pic 
will output TeX, it is possible to use
.Nm
with TeX.
.Pp
The 
.Fl d
option specifies a file of macro definitions to be read at startup,
and defaults to DEFINES.
The
.Fl D
option inhibits the reading of any initial macros file.
.Pp
All
.Nm
commands are included between 
.Ic .G1
and
.Ic .G2
macros, which are consumed by 
.Nm .
The output contains pic between
.Ic .PS
and
.Ic .PE
macros.  Any arguments to the
.Ic .G1
macro in the input are arguments to the
.Ic .PS
macro in the output, so graphs can be scaled just like pic diagrams.
.Pp
The 
.Nm
commands are sketched below.  Refer to Kernighan and Bentley's paper
for the details.

.Ar line_description 
.Ek

.Oc
.Bd -filled -offset indent
This describes how the axes for the graph are drawn. A
.Ar line_description 
is a pic line description, e.g., dashed 0.5, or the literal
.Li solid .
If the first 
.Ar line_description 
is given, the frame is drawn with that style.  The default is 
.Li solid .
The height and width of the frame can also be specified in inches.
The default line style can be over-ridden for sides of the frame by
specifying additional parameters to
.Ic frame .
.Ed 
.Pp
.Ic draw
.Op Ar line_name
.Op Ar line_description
.Op Ar plot_string 
.Bd -filled -offset indent
The
.Ic draw
command defines the style with which a given line will be plotted.  If
.Ar line_name 
is given, the style is associated with that name, otherwise the
default style is set.  
.Ar line_description
is a pic line description, and the optional
.Ar plot_string
is a string to be centered at each point.  The default line
description is
.Li invis ,
and the default plotting string is a centered bullet, so by default
each point is a filled cricle, and they are unconnected.
If points are being connected, each
.Ic draw
command ends any current line and begins a new one.
.Pp
.Ic new
is a synonym for 
.Ic draw .
.Ed 
.Pp
.Ic next
.Op Ar line_name
.Cm at
.Op Ar coordinates_name 
.Ar expr ,  expr
.Op Ar line_description 
.Bd -filled -offset indent
The 
.Ic next
command plots the given point using the line style given by
.Ar line_name ,
or the default if none is given.  If
.Ar line_name
is given, it should have been defined by an earlier
.Ic draw
command, if not a new line style with that name is created,
initialized the same way as the default style.  The two expressions
give the point's x and y values, relative to the optional coordinate
system.  That system should have been defined by an earlier
.Ic coord
command, if not, grap will exit.  If the optional
.Ar line_description
is given, it overrides the style's default line description.  You
cannot over-ride the plotting string.  To use a different plotting
string use the 
.Ic plot
command.
.Pp
The coordinates may optionally be enclosed in parentheses: 
.Ar ( expr ,  expr )

.Op Ar string_modifiers 
.Oo

.Ar expr , expr
.Pp
.Ic plot 
.Ar expr
.Op Ar format_string 
.Cm at
.Op Ar coordinates_name 
.Ar expr , expr
.Bd -filled -offset indent
These commands both plot a string at the given point.  In the first
case the literal strings are stacked above each other.  The string
modifiers include the
.Xr pic 
justification modifiers, and absolute and
relative
.Li size
modifiers.
.IP
.Li size
.Ar expr
sets the string size to 
.Ar expr
points.  If 
.Ar expr
is preceded by a + or -, the size is increased or decreased by that
many points.
.Pp
In the second version, the 
.Ar expr
is converted to a string and placed on the graph.  
.Ar format_string 
is a 
.Xr printf 3
format string.  Only formatting escapes for printing
floating point numbers make sense.
.Pp
points are specified the same way as for 
.Ic next
commands, with the same consequences for undefined coordinate systems.
.Pp
The second form of this command is completely unnecessary because the
first form can be used with a 
.Nm
.Ic sprintf
experssion (See
.Sx Expressions ) .

.Bd -filled -offset indent
This command controls the placement of ticks on the frame.  By
default, ticks are automatically generated on the left and bottom
sides of the frame.
.Pp
The simplest version of this command turns on the automatic tick
generation for a given side.  The tick direction is controlled by
specifying
.Cm in
or
.Cm out ,
modified by an expression that gives the length of the ticks in
inches.
.Pp
The second version of the
.Ic ticks
command over-rides the automatic placement of the ticks by specifying
a list of coordinates at which to place the ticks.  If the ticks are
not defined with respect to the default coordinate system, the
.Ar coord_name
parameter must be given.  For each tick a 
.Xr printf 3
style format string can be given.  The
.Ar format_string
defaults to
.Qq %g .  
To place ticks with no labels, specify 
.Ar format_string 
as
.Qq \& .
.Pp
The labels on the ticks may be shifted by specifying a direction and
the distance in inches to offset the label.  That is the optional
direction and expression immediately preceding the 
.Cm at .
.Pp
The third format of the 
.Ic ticks
command over-rides the default tick generation with a set of ticks ar
regular intervals.  The syntax is reminiscent of programming
language for loops.  Ticks are placed starting at
.Ar start_expr
ending at
.Ar end_expr
one unit apart.  If the
.Cm by
clause is specified, ticks are
.Ar by_expr
units apart.  If an operator appears before
.Ar by_expr
each tick is operated on by that operator instead of +.  For example
.Bd -literal -offset indent-two
ticks left out from 2 to 32 by *2
.Ed
.Pp
will put ticks at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  If
.Ar format_string
is specified, all ticks are formatted using it.
.Pp
The parameters preceding the
.Cm from
act as described above.
.Pp
The 
.Cm at
and 
.Cm for
forms of tick command may both be issued on the same
side of a frame.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent-two
ticks left out from 2 to 32 by *2
ticks left in 3, 5, 7
.Ed
.Pp
will put ticks on the left side of the frame pointing out at 2, 4, 8,
16, and 32 and in at 3, 5, and 7.
.Pp
The final form of 
.Ic ticks
turns off ticks on a given side.  If no side is given the ticks for
all sides are cancelled.
.Pp
.Ic tick
is a synonym for 
.Ic ticks .

The
.Ic grid
command is similar to the 
.Ic ticks
command except that 
.Ic grid
specifies the placement of lines in the frame.  The sysntax is similar
to 
.Ic ticks
as well.  
.Pp
By specifying 
.Li ticks off
in the command, no ticks are drawn on that side of the frame.  If
ticks appear on a side by default, or have been declared by an earlier
.Ic ticks
command, 
.Ic grid
does not cancel them unless 
.Li tciks off
is specified.
.Pp
Instead of a direction for ticks, 
.Ic grid
allows the user to pick a line descriptionfor the grid lines.  The
usual
.Xr pic 1
line descriptions are allowed.
.Pp
Grids are labelled by default.  To omit labels, specify the format
string as

.Bd -filled -offset indent
The 
.Ic label
command places a label on the given axis.  It is possible to specify
several labels, which will be stacked over each other as in 
.Xr pic 1 .
The final argument, if present, specifies how many inches the label is
shifted from the axis.
.Pp
By default the labels on the left and right labels run parallel to the
frame.  You can cancel this by specifying 
.Li unaligned 
as a 
.Ar string_modifier .

.Ic circle

.Bd -filled -offset indent
This draws an unfilled circle at the point indicated.  By default, the
circle is small, 0.025 inches.  This can be over-ridden by specifying
a radius.  The coordinates of the point are relative to the named
coordinate system, or the default system if none is specified.

This draws a line or arrow from the first point to the second using
the given style.  The default line style is 
.Li solid .
The 
.Ar line_description
can be given either before the
.Cm from
or after the 
.Cm to
clause.  If both are given the second is used.  It is possible to
specify one point in one coordinate system and one in another, note
that if both points are in a named coordinate system, both points must
have
.Ar coordinate_name
given.

.Bd -filled -offset indent
The
.Ic coord
command specifies a new coordinate system or sets limits on the
default system.  It defines the largest and smallest values that can
be plotted, and therefore the scale of the data in the frame.  The
limits for the x and y coordinate systems can be given separately.  If
a 
.Ar name
is given, that coordinate system is defined, if not the default system
is modified.
.Pp
This command also determines if a scale is plotted logarithmically.
Unlike K&B 
.Nm grap ,
this program accepts exactly one of the three logarithm
specifications.

.Ic copy

.Pp
.Ic copy
.Op Qq Ar filename
.Op Cm until Qq Ar string
.Cm thru Ar macro
.Bd -filled -offset indent
The
.Ic copy
command imports data from another file into the current graph.  The
first form is a simple file inclusion; the included file is simply
read into the input stream and can contain arbitrary
.Nm
commands.
.Pp
The second form takes lines from the file, splits them into words
delimited by one or more spaces, and calls the given macro with those
words as parameters.  The macro may either be defined here, or be a
macro defined earlier.  See
.Sx Macros
for more information on macros.
.Pp
The
.Ar filename
may be omitted from the second form if the 
.Cm until
clause is present.  If so the current file is treated as the input
file until
.Ar string
is encountered at the beginning of the line.
.Pp
.Ic copy
is one of the workhorses of 
.Nm grap .
