Change log

0.92a: bug fix - string equality check.  Small change to Makefile.in
to support default Solaris behavior.  Added -v for version info.  Some
general internals fiddling (I'd like to call it cleanup, but I think
that's generous).

0.91a: small changes for the RPM

0.9a: Added commands for making bars.  

Error reporting is much closer to the correct line now.

Generalized line descriptions for fillable objects.  

Circles now take a line description.  Added new examples of fillable
objects.

Now using the BSD copyright notice instead of my own half-baked one.

0.8a: alpha release
