0.93a: bug fix: deleting grap_buffer_state contents twice on error, allow 
more than one shift description on ticks, grids, and labels.  Thanks to
Anindo Banerjea at ISI for spotting my misimplementation.

Another couple of Bannerjea catches: through is now recognized as a
synonym for thru.  "For," "then" and "else" clauses were previously
treated as macros but now have a terminating separator added to them.  The result is that things like

if (x == 3) { y = y + 1 }
x = x + 1

work now.  (If the { } is treated as a macro defined and expanded on
the spot, the grap parser sees y = y + 1x = x + 1 and cannot parse the
expression y+1x).  The new behavior is both more intuitive and more in
line with previous grap implementations.

0.92a: bug fix - string equality check.  Small change to Makefile.in
to support default Solaris behavior.  Added -v for version info.  Some
general internals fiddling (I'd like to call it cleanup, but I think
that's generous).

0.91a: small changes for the RPM

0.9a: Added commands for making bars.  

Error reporting is much closer to the correct line now.

Generalized line descriptions for fillable objects.  

Circles now take a line description.  Added new examples of fillable
objects.

Now using the BSD copyright notice instead of my own half-baked one.

0.8a: alpha release
